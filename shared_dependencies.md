3. **URL Names**: URL names defined in `urls.py` are used in `views.py` for redirecting and rendering views, and in templates for creating links.

4. **Template Names**: `home.html` and `base.html` are used in `views.py` for rendering views, and in each other for template inheritance.

5. **Static Files**: `styles.css` and `scripts.js` are used in the HTML templates for styling and interactivity.

9. **Django Apps**: The app name defined in `apps.py` is used in `settings.py` for including the app, and in `urls.py` for including the app's URLs.

10. **Django Migrations**: Migrations defined in `migrations/0001_initial.py` are used by Django's migration system for applying database changes.
